This repository contains the code (in R language) that was used to generate all the analyses presented in the manuscript “Pan-cancer analysis of the genomic alterations and mutations of the matrisome” by Valerio Izzi, Martin N. Davis and Alexandra Naba. Also, for transparency and reproducibility, we have enclosed a section on questions from (and answers to) reviewers.

Raw data are too big to fit in the repository, but they can be downloaded from Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.3889651).

Code is also available in HTML format at https://www.rpubs.com/Izzilab/matrisome-CNAs-and-mutations
